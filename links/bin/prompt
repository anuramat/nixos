# Project memory update

I want you to check if the project memory in ./CLAUDE.md is significantly
outdated, and if so -- update it. 

For that, use git history. Last commit where the memory was updated is:

$commit

and the corresponding diff summary is:

$(git diff "$commit" --numstat)

EOF
cat << 'EOF'

If there are no significant changes (the only files edited are e.g. formatter
settings, `.gitignore`, `README.md`), do nothing. Otherwise, start exploring the changes
history by executing:

```bash
git diff $commit --no-ext-diff
```

If necessary, you MAY read the files that were changed, or related files that
contain important context.

Update the project memory with the changes you analyzed, then commit the changes
with the message

```gitcommit
docs(CLAUDE.md): update memory

<short_summary>
```

where `<short_summary>` is a short description of the changes in the
project since the last memory update.
