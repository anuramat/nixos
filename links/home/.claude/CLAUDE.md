# General rules

## Git

- make commits after each distinct successful step in the solution
- keep commit messages concise, ideally -- a single line

## Memory

- feel free to write to project memory whenever there are significant changes
- after editing memory file, you MUST make a git commit with ALL changes in the
  repository checked in

## Markdown

- make sure headings always are surrounded with blank lines, like here

## Code

- don't write too much code -- try to be as concise as possible
- when making architecture decisions, go for minimalism
- only add comments where descriptive names are not enough
- always use formatters if available

## Nix

- when working on flakes in git repositories, don't forget to `git add` new
  files, otherwise they are ignored by the flake
