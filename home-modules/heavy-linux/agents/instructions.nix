          Background:
          The user has to review the code thoroughly after the task is completed.
          The main limiting factor is the sheer amount of new/changed lines.
          You should aim for the smallest possible amount of code that does the job -- this will make it easier for the user to review the changes.
          This does not apply to temporary files (e.g. debugging/test scripts), i.e. you can write as much code as you need in temporary files.

          - You MUST write concise code that prioritizes brevity and elegance over verbosity and caution.
          - You MUST NOT implement features that are neither explicitly requested by the user nor indirectly required.
          - You MUST avoid excessive comments, exhaustive error handling and edge case checks.

          - To find required packages in `nixpkgs`, you SHOULD use `nh search $PACKAGE_NAME`.
          - You MUST NOT use `nix search`, it's slow and unstable; instead, use `nh search`
          - To explore NixOS options, you SHOULD use `nixos-option $OPTION_NAME`

          Examples:

          <example>
            <user>How do I configure git in home-manager?</user>
            <assistant>I am going to use `nixos-option` to find the corresponding option</assistant>
            <bash_command>home-manager.users.${username}.programs.git</bash_command>
            <bash_output>
            This attribute set contains:
            aliases

          </example>

            Assistant uses `nixos-option` to explore the options available for configuring git in home-manager.

          Assistant first tries to run the command, and because it's not found, it uses `nh search` to find the corresponding package.

          ${head} Acceptance criteria identification

          Before starting a development task you MUST explicitly state acceptance criteria,
          and add a criteria verification check (e.g. "Check tests") as a final step to your plan/todo list${
            if (args.planningTool != null) then " using the `${args.planningTool}` tool" else ""
          }.

          After finishing the task, you MUST verify that the solution meets the acceptance criteria.
          If some criteria are NOT met, you MUST continue iterating on the problem, until ALL the acceptance criteria are met.
          The task CAN NOT be considered complete until ALL the acceptance criteria are met.

          If the user asks you to fix a failing command, successful execution of this command MUST be added as a criterion.

          Typical acceptance criteria:

          <example>
            <user>implement a new feature: ...</user>
            <acceptance_criteria>
              1. All currently passing tests remain passing.
              2. The project builds successfully.
              3. New tests are added and pass.
            </acceptance_criteria>
          </example>
          <example>
            <user>a command is failing: ...</user>
            <acceptance_criteria>
              I will add the following acceptance criteria to my plan:
              1. All currently passing tests remain passing.
              2. The specific command that was failing now succeeds.
            </acceptance_criteria>
          </example>
          <example>
            <user>add a flake for the project</user>
            <acceptance_criteria>
              I will add the following acceptance criteria to my plan:
              1. `nix build` succeeds.
              2. The program runs successfully using `nix run`.
            </acceptance_criteria>
